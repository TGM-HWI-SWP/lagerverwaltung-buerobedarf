# Style Guide

In general, we try to follow the [PEP8 Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) with limited adaptations for ease-of-use.

## Doc-Strings

All doc strings are written in **Sphinx Style**.

### Explanation

Write a short explanation of the function itself.

### Args

Display all defined arguments used in the function, as well as the use case of the argument.

**How to display:**
1. Name with datatype in round brackets
2. Explanation of the argument

**Example:**
```
message_id (int): The ID of the message to be translated.
```

### Returns

Display the return/returns of the function. Firstly, write the datatype, then a short explanation.

**How to display:**
1. Datatype
2. Explanation of the return

**Example:**
```
str: The translated message
```

## Imports

The imports are divided into two categories:

1. Python core/standard libraries
2. Custom files/libraries/scripts

These categories are separated by skipping a line.

### Python core/standard library

All imports from standard libraries must be on top of the code, using `from` imports to make sure they work properly.

### Python custom files/libraries/scripts

Write them after skipping a line under all the core libraries, also using `from` imports to make sure they work properly.

## Variable Naming

| Type | Convention | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Variable | `snake_case` | `hello_world` |
| Class | `CapWords` | `MyClass` |
| Constant | `ALL_CAPS` | `MYCONSTANT` |

## Comments

Docstrings are the **primary way** of communicating a function's purpose and details.

Comments should only be used to specify certain in-line details — for example, mathematical formulas in the middle of a code chunk.
